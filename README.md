## About

This is an attempt to turn your mobile phone into a convenient and practical musical instrument.

Similar to a diatonic harmonica, you can only play notes in a certain key,
however the key can be changed quickly and easily.

Play on your mobile phone, using the thumbs of both hands.
Visit [thumbophone.ftwinston.com](http://thumbophone.ftwinston.com) to try it now.

Enjoy!
